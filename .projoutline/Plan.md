## Quick overview

Basically a golf game, turn-based game, co-op game, RPG (skills), and platformer, and some hints of a roguelike

## Modes

### Vs

Normal campaign maps, but with a twist! Coins/objectives are removed, and each player makes all their turns in one go, then it will swap to the other player to try and beat the score set!

Also possibly some smaller (but harder) maps specifically for this mode.

2-4 Players.

### Co-op

Play through the normal campaign maps but with a friend(s)! Sit back, relax, and have a great time with your friend(s). Try not to hit them off though!
